2.) No NSFW content. 
3.) Got any cool unit builds?
4.) Please refrain from spoiling games. Especially Fire Emblem games, since it's likely people in the chat are in the middle of playing them. 
5.) Fire Emblem is bad and you should feel bad. 
6.) Oliver is more beautiful than we mortals deserve. 
7.) Don't spam too much. If you have something complicated to say, keep it in one concise message. No need to post a dozen different messages for one sentence. 
8.) Admins are not allowed to abuse their powers.
